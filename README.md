This is a simple function for Multi-dependent variable stepwise reference, using R. There is also a sub function to calculate the sweep transform of a matrix simply.

A demo is set to see how the function works. The function also can used for one dependent variable but may not be as good as professional ones. This function may be added to this repository later if I get enough time :)

See the file inside and check the notes for further information.
